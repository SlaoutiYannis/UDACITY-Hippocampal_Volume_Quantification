# UDACITY-Hippocampal_Volume_Quantification
Udacity project: Hippocampal Volume Quantification in Alzheimer's Progression. (This project is made of 3 parts)

In this project you will build an end-to-end AI system which features a machine learning algorithm that integrates into a clinical-grade viewer and automatically measures hippocampal volumes of new patients, as their studies are committed to the clinical imaging archive.

Fortunately you won't have to deal with full heads of patients. Our (fictional) radiology department runs a HippoCrop tool which cuts out a rectangular portion of a brain scan from every image series, making your job a bit easier, and our committed radiologists have collected and annotated a dataset of relevant volumes, and even converted them to NIFTI format!

You will use the dataset that contains the segmentations of the right hippocampus and you will use the U-Net architecture to build the segmentation model.

After that, you will proceed to integrate the model into a working clinical PACS such that it runs on every incoming study and produces a report with volume measurements.
